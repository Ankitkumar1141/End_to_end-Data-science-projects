# Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project aims to **predict the delivery time of food orders** using machine learning techniques. We perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **visualizations**, and build predictive models to estimate the expected delivery time based on various features of the order.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is provided in the file:

* `Food Delivery Time Prediction Case Study.xlsx`

It contains historical data of food orders, with features such as order time, distance, restaurant type, and actual delivery time.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* Python
* pandas, numpy
* matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn

## 🔍 Workflow

✅ **Step 1: Data Loading & Cleaning**

* Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
* Handle missing values and clean data as required.

✅ **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Summary statistics.
* Distribution plots of delivery time and features.
* Correlation analysis between features and target.

✅ **Step 3: Data Visualization**

* Visualize trends, patterns, and relationships in the data using barplots, boxplots, heatmaps, etc.

✅ **Step 4: Feature Engineering**

* Create or transform features to improve model performance.

✅ **Step 5: Model Building**

* Split the data into train/test sets.
* Train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R².

✅ **Step 6: Results & Insights**

* Interpret the results.
* Suggest business insights and possible improvements in delivery operations.

## 📊 Expected Outcome

A machine learning model capable of predicting delivery time for new orders, along with insights into which factors impact delivery performance the most.
